 ## Introduction
 
The use of satellite imagery for detection has become increasingly important for a wide variety of applications. Tree detection is one of the important applications of detecting from satellite images. 
In this project, a dataset was prepared by labelling trees in some regions of Turkey with Python's library LabelImg. Then, the object detection algorithm, one of the machine learning techniques, was used. Roboflow and YOLOv5 Object Detection Model were used during Object detection.
